              <p>The novel opens with Guy Montag, a “fireman” in a futuristic society where he and his coworkers start fires rather than put them out. Books are banned and burned upon discovery, and Montag has no qualms about his responsibility. Who wouldn't love getting paid to set things on fire?</p>
